****************

The file type *.XYZ is not supported
------------------------------------
Send us an mail. We will have a look at this.

Will there be an app for smartphones?
-------------------------------------
Sometime and somehow there will be an app for smartphones. But this has no high priority, because we're just in the beginning for the API.
The first step will be to connect RUNALYZE with already existing apps.

Will there be an synchronisation between other plattforms?

We will try to make a synchronisation possible between other platforms. For the beginning we may support tapiriik to have a fast sync possibility between other platforms.

When will RUNALYZE support international units of measure?
----------------------------------------------------------
The support will hopefully come in the release after version 2.2

When will RUNALYZE recognize double activities?
-----------------------------------------------
We have no date for this, but it has a high priority for us!
