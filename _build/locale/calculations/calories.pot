msgid "Figuring out how many calories you burn when running, cycling or whatsoever is not easy and, to be honest, we did not put much effort into this topic so far. For the time being, RUNALYZE does use values provided within uploaded files and does not recalculate this value. This value is only recalculated if you've checked *Calculate calories* in your configuration *and* change the duration of the activity. In this case burned calories are calculated by simply multiplying the activity's duration by your sports setting *kilocalories per hour*."

msgid "RUNALYZE uses the metric unit *kilocalorie* so far although it's superseded by *kilojoule*. You want to have the choice? Leave a +1 `at GitHub <https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze/issues/1837>`_."
