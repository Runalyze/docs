msgid "If you have a concrete concept for a new feature, don't hesitate to submit your idea at `GitHub <https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze/issues/new>`_. This is the best place to discuss ideas and future features with other users and developers."

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:25
msgid "Will there be an app for smartphones?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:26
msgid "Some day, probably. So far, this is not a high priority as there are many other areas requiring our full attention."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:31
msgid "Will there be a synchronisation with other platforms?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:32
msgid "Some day, probably. Our first concern is providing an API to work with `tapiriik <https://tapiriik.com/>`_. Still, there are months of work waiting for us until this is realizable. With every new release we are getting closer to this feature."

msgid "Can I publish my running diary?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:40

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:43
msgid "Anyway, you can mark single activities as public and share them by publishing a public url, or publish your entire list of activities. Have a look at your privacy configuration for detailed information. Furthermore, you can export any activity as html snippet or iframe and share them on twitter/facebook/google+."

#: ../../faq.rst:50
msgid "What are calculations and prognoses?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:51
msgid "RUNALYZE is more than just a logbook to track all your activities. In addition to well known basic features RUNALYZE offers you statistics like VDOT and prognoses for your upcoming races. We are using some formulas derived by `Jack Daniels' famous Running Formula* <http://amzn.to/1GnAv43>`_ to estimate your current shape based on the ratio of heart rate and pace. Still, these estimates must be handled with great caution. Don't rely on them and listen to your body."

#: ../../faq.rst:59
msgid "The file import seems buggy? Incorrect values?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:60
msgid "Send us an email with your sample file and a detailed description of what your expected results. We'll have a look at your issue and will try to fix it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:66
msgid "Runalyze shows an incorrect total duration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:67
msgid "Most file types do not contain information about pauses. Especially tcx- and gpx-files provide no information if and when you stopped your device, e.g. at traffic lights or if you're using 'auto pause' on your device. Runalyze offers the ability to detect such breaks automatically and can remove them without further notice. Still, it's difficult or even impossible to exactly match your device's total duration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:71
msgid "You can enable/disable our automatic detection of pauses in your configuration. In addition, we have an `open ticket <https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze/issues/913>`_ for a more flexible solution such that a specific threshold can be defined for each file separately. Feel free to leave a '+1' at GitHub."

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:86
msgid "You can edit your maximum heart rate in the \"Body values\" panel. You may need to activate that panel (Configuration -> Panels)"
