msgid "As Garmin extended the FIT file format, external sensors can now write their own data into any FIT file. This allows third party devices to write data that's not part of the official FIT specification. In addition, sensors can write their own data for common fields (e.g. distance, heart rate, power, ...) without being connected as the respective sensor. Previously, Stryd was only able to record power data in cycling mode."
