How many calories did I burn?
*****************************
Figuring out how many calories you burn when running, cycling or whatsoever is
not easy and, to be honest, we did not put much effort into this topic so far.
For the time being, RUNALYZE does use values provided within uploaded files and
does not recalculate this value. This value is only recalculated if you've
checked *Calculate calories* in your configuration *and* change the duration of
the activity. In this case burned calories are calculated by simply multiplying
the activity's duration by your sports setting *kilocalories per hour*.

.. note::
    There's an `open issue <https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze/issues/1090>`_
    for using a better formula for calculating burned calories. Feel free to
    leave a +1 or contribute.
