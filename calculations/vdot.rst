VDOT
====

VDOT is the shortform of V-dot-O2Max, the maximum rate of oxygen flow.	This value is a good measurement for the possible performance of a runner.	Due to some additional factors, one talks about a pseudo V-dot-O2Max, which is equal for all runners at the same level.

Jack Daniels' famous Running formula serves some tables estimating the VDOT value. These formulas are used to estimate your VDOT and predict your race performances.

Your personal VDOT value is estimated based on the ratio of heart rate and pace in every of your runs.	The average over a given period is considered as your current shape.

Each VDOT value of an activity in RUNALYZE is marked with an arrow, to show if this value is (much) higher than your current shape, equal to it or (much) lower.

.. note::
    Of course, pauses, walking and other factors can heavily influence the ratio of heart rate and pace.	Activities with known influences or strange results can be ignored for the calculation of your shape.

In RUNALYZE you have the option to change the VDOT calculation, so that it is adapted to your requierements.

Manual correction factor
-------------------------
If you think your VDOT correction factor, which is based on your best competition is wrong/not perfect, you can add a manual correction factor. A correction factor between 0.85 and 0.95 should be realistic

Adapt VDOT for elevation
-------------------
If you make many vertical meters in your actitivies the VDOT may have a negative influence to your form. You can enable the adaption for elevation in the VDOT settings. You can set the correction per positive and negative elevation.
