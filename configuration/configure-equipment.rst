.. note::
          We will improve the form/design for adding new equipment (objects or categories) when we have a new design.

In version 2.2 we added a new equipment system which is a replacement for shoes and clothes we had before.

What can I add to the equipment?
*********************************

Anything you want. You can add bike gear, shoes, ski gear. Just anything.

Adding an equipment category
****************************

Go to Configuration -> Equipment to add a new equipment object/category.

 If you want to add a new equipment category you have to fill out the last, greyed-out row.

 * Add the name of the equipment category
 * Choose the correct type for the equipment:
   * Single choice = You can choose only one object for one activity
   * Multiple choice  = You can select mulitple objects for one activity
 * You can add a maximal distance (in km) or a maximal time if you want to. This is used for displaying a progress bar in the equipment widget.
 * You can assign a category to one or more sports types. Hold `ctrl` (Windows) or `cmd` (MacOS) to select multiple sports types.

 .. note::
           Attention: If you delete a category all equipment objects of this category as well as all relations between your activities and this equipment object will be deleted!
