With this tutorial we want to show you how to add and edit a new sport.

Creating a new sports type is as easily as editing an existing one:
Just fill out the last, greyed-out row and click 'Save'.

We are now going to explain every configuration setting:

^^^^
Icon
^^^^

Pick an icon for your sport type.

^^^^
Name
^^^^

Type in the name of the sport

^^^^^^
kcal/h
^^^^^^

How many calories are consumed during one hour?
Attention! If you import activites from a device which contains a value for calories, that value will be used.
If the value is not present the calories will be calculated based on this configuration value.

^^^^
Ã˜ HR
^^^^

You can set a default average heart rate as fallback. This value is used for TRIMP calculation.

^^
km
^^

Set a checkmark if the sport has a distance (true for e.g. running/cycling/swimming, but false for e.g. gymnastics).

^^^^
Unit
^^^^

Choose a unit for displaying your speed/pace.

^^^^^
Types
^^^^^

Set a checkmark if you want to add different activity types to this sport.

^^^^^
Power
^^^^^

Set a checkmark if the power (watt) is recorded or should be calculated by RUNALYZE.

^^^^^^^
Outside
^^^^^^^

Set a checkmark if this sport can be performed outside.
This checkbox activates the fields routes and weather in the form.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Main equipment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose a main equipment category which will be used in the databrowser view if you have activated the "Main Equipment" value to show up.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Default sport type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose a default sport type which shows up if you change the sport of an activity in the form. In a later version we will use this type for automatic uploaded activities.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Calendar view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can choose the type of presentation of an activity in the databrowser/calendar.
'*Complete row*' means that you see the complete dataset (as configured in the dataset configuration)
'*Only icon*' means that only the icons of the sport shows up in the databrowser/calendar.
