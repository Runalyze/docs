Activity types
===============

If you have activated the “Types” checkbox in the sport configuration of a sport, you can define different activity types.

For running we already added some types to make the start with RUNALYZE easy.

Activity types are useful to seperate your training into different categories.

We are now going to explain every activity type configuration setting:

^^^^
Name
^^^^

Should speak for itself. Type in the “long” name of the activity type.

^^^^^^^^^^^^
Abbreviation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The abbreviation is used in the databrowser and whereever the name is too long.

^^^^^
Sport
^^^^^

Select the sport for this activity type.

^^^^
Ø HR
^^^^

Similar to sports configuration, the average heart rate is used as fallback for TRIMP calculation. This value overrides the one from your sports configuration.

^^^^^^^^
Quality?
^^^^^^^^

Set a checkmark if the activity type is a qualitiy session (e.g. interval workouts).

^^^^
Race
^^^^

Set a checkmark if the activity type is the 'Race' type.

.. note::
          Currently you can set a 'Race' typ for running only. We will change this in the future.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Calendar view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can choose the typ of presentation of an activity in the databrowser/calendar.
'*Complete row*' means that you see the complete dataset (as configured in the dataset configuration)
'*Only icon*' means that only the icons of the sport shows up in the databrowser/calendar.
This overrides the sport configuration setting.

.. note::
        Activity types can only be deleted if no references to activities exists.
