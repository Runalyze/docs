Feature requests
****************

The file type *.XYZ is not supported
------------------------------------
Send us an mail. We will have a look at this.

Will there be an app for smartphones?
-------------------------------------
Sometime and somehow there will be an app for smartphones. But this has no high priority, because we're just in the beginning of the API (planning and working on the RUNALYZE core).
The first step will be to connect RUNALYZE with already existing apps.

Will there be an synchronisation between other plattforms?
----------------------------------------------------------
We will try to make a synchronisation possible between other platforms. For the beginning we may support tapiriik to have a fast sync possibility between other platforms.

When will RUNALYZE support timezones?
-------------------------------------
We have no date for this, but it has a high priority for us!

When will RUNALYZE recognize double activities?
-----------------------------------------------
We have no date for this, but it has a high priority for us!

Miscellaneous
**************

Can I publish my running diary?
-------------------------------
Until now you can export your activites as a HTML-Snippet or iFrame. Vistor can view your activity via a link (when you made it public).
In addition you can also publish your entire week/month view.
Have a look at you privacy settings for more presice settings.

What are calculations and prognoses?
------------------------------------
In RUNALYZE we use some tables/derived formular by `Daniel's Running Formula <http://amzn.to/1GnAv43>`_ . Especially the prognoses takes a very simple approach to determine from the ratio between heart rate and pace the highest potential possible performance.
Therefore these prognoses must be handled with great caution.

The file import seems buggy? The data is wrong?
------------------------------------------------
Let us know: Send the corresponding file to us and explain which values/data are wrong.
