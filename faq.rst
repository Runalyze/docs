If you have a concrete concept for a new feature, don't hesitate to submit your idea at `GitHub <https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze/issues/new>`_.
This is the best place to discuss ideas and future features with other users and developers.

Please keep in mind that RUNALYZE is an open source project, at present based mainly on two developers offering their free time for this tool.

----

The file type \*.XYZ is not supported
*************************************
Just send us an email with some sample files and we'll have a look at this.

----

Will there be an app for smartphones?
*************************************
Some day, probably. So far, this is not a high priority as there are many other areas requiring our full attention.

----

Will there be a synchronisation with other platforms?
*****************************************************
Some day, probably. Our first concern is providing an API to work with `tapiriik <https://tapiriik.com/>`_.
Still, there are months of work waiting for us until this is realizable. With every new release we are getting closer to this feature.

----

When will RUNALYZE support timezones?
*************************************
We can't announce any dates but we have this in mind. We're already working on it and will add it probably in version 2.5.

----

When will RUNALYZE recognize double activities?
***********************************************
We will support this starting from version 2.4

----

Can I publish my running diary?
*******************************
Fundamentally, RUNALYZE is not designed to be a new athletes community.
Our main focus lies on analyzing your training.

Anyway, you can mark single activities as public and share them by publishing a public url, or publish your entire list of activities.
Have a look at your privacy configuration for detailed information.
Furthermore, you can export any activity as html snippet or iframe and share them on twitter/facebook/google+.

----

What are calculations and prognoses?
************************************
RUNALYZE is more than just a logbook to track all your activities.
In addition to well known basic features RUNALYZE offers you statistics like VDOT and prognoses for your upcoming races.
We are using some formulas derived by `Jack Daniel's famous Running Formula* <http://amzn.to/1GnAv43>`_ to estimate your current shape based on the ratio of heart rate and pace.
Still, these estimates must be handled with great caution. Don't rely on them and listen to your body.

----

The file import seems buggy? Incorrect values?
**********************************************
Send us an email with your sample file and a detailed description of what your expected results.
We'll have a look at your issue and will try to fix it.
