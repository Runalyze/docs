Where can I change my maximum heart rate?
-------------------------------------------
You can edit your maximum heart rate in the "Body values" panel. You may need to activate that panel (Configuration -> Panels)

Is there an impact when I change the sport relevance?
-------------------------------------------------------------
The categorization as 'main sports' and 'alternative sports' is just a preparation for future analyses. It's planned that one can group alternative sports and handle them as additional but less important training load.
