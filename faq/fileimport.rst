File import
==========================

.. contents:: :local:


Bulk file import
------------------
There is no real bulk file import in the moment. If you want to import a lot of files you need to upload them in bunches or send us all your activities and your username by mail (please use something like `wetransfer.com <https://wetransfer.com/>`_ for big attachments). We will import them directly into your account.

The file import seems buggy? Incorrect values?
------------------------------------------------
Send us an email with your sample file and a detailed description of what your expected results.
We'll have a look at your issue and will try to fix it.

FIT file - Swim heartrate isn't imported
------------------------------------------
FIT file format - Heartrate from swim fit files cannot be saved in the moment (`Issue #1498 <https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze/issues/1498>`_)


The file type \*.XYZ is not supported
--------------------------------------
We already support a lot of different file types. If there is a good reason if we should support further file formats then send us an email with some sample files and we will have a look at it.

CSV file is not supported
----------------------------
In the moment we only support csv files by Epson and Wahoo. 
The import will fail if you upload other kind of csv files. It also makes little sense to import the CSV file from Garmin, because it contains only the averages and not the entire activity. RUNALYZE needs all the activity to calculate reliable prognosis.
