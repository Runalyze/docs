If you have a concrete concept for a new feature, don't hesitate to submit and discuss your idea at our `Forum <https://forum.runalyze.com>`_.
This is the best place to discuss ideas and future features with other users and developers.


Will there be a synchronisation with other platforms?
--------------------------------------------------------
Yes, definitely! Our first concern is providing an API for some apps. In the beginning the API will be limited for uploading new activities.
Still, there is a lot of prework waiting for us until this is realizable, but we are getting closer. Current schedule for this feature is in Q2/Q3 2018.

Will there be an app for smartphones?
--------------------------------------
Some day, probably. So far, this is not a high priority as there are many other areas requiring our full attention.


My activity does not show up in my race results
-------------------------------------------------
Every activity of any sport can be marked as a race by simply checking the respective checkbox. It is not enought to change the activity type to "race". :doc:`Read more <starting-guide/races>`.


The translation is missing
----------------------------
Translations are maintained by our users and we cannot guarantee that everything has been translated when we roll out a new version. :doc:`You can help us! <translation>`.

There is a phantom race in the sports panel
--------------------------------------------
Occasionally, training sessions that are in the future will be entered. This happens especially if a file format was used which is not standardized or if a manual activity was entered with an incorrect date. Use the search function in Runalyze to find these activities.
