Can I publish my running diary?
--------------------------------
Fundamentally, RUNALYZE is in the moment not designed to be an athletes community.
Our main focus is on analyzing your training.

Anyway, you can mark single activities as public and share them by publishing a public url, or publish your entire list of activities.
Have a look at your privacy configuration for detailed information.
Furthermore, you can export any activity as html snippet or iframe and share them on twitter/facebook/google+.
