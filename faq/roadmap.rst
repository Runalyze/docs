=========
Roadmap
=========

There is no fixed roadmap at RUNALYZE, but the following are the topics that have the highest priority for us

Sync from x to RUNALYZE
-------------------------

Our top priority is to synchronize activity data from Polar, Suunto and TomTom to Runalyze.
We need to do some prework before we can develop on this as we expect higher usage of RUNALYZE due this change.

HR/Power zones
----------------

Long promised and not yet implemented. The possibility to set the different zones yourself.


Done
=======
RUNALYZE API
---------------
The first part of the API will be limited to upload activities to RUNALYZE by apps like RunnerUP and similiar.
See the full list of supported apps directly in RUNALYZE (Username menu->Apps)

Sync from Garmin to RUNALYZE
------------------------------
Finally online!
