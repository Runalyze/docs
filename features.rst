Analysis
----------

.. raw:: html

   <i class="fa fa-battery-full fa-2x fa-pull-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>

| **TRIMP principle**
| TRIMP is short for *Training Impulse* and gives you the opportunity to compare activities of different intensity levels based on this value.
|

   <i class="fa fa-expand fa-2x fa-pull-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>

| **VDOT estimation**
| VDOT is a virtual value invented by `Jack Daniels in his “Running formula” <http://amzn.to/2cgSo9v>`_ to compare race results of different distances with each other.
| Runalyze goes one step ahead: We estimate your current vdot shape based on your heart rate and pace of every activity.

| **Prediction**
| You can choose your favorite model to predict your upcoming race: CPP by Robert Bock, a simple method by Herbert Steffny, calculations by David Cameron or our VDOT method based on Jack Daniels' formulas.

| **Prediction based on your shape**
| Most models predict your race performance based on your personal bests on different distances, but that does not always fit your current shape. Our vdot estimations can be used to give much more accurate predictions.
