If you want to record your activities with an Apple Watch and export the activities directly to RUNALYZE, we recommend the `HealtFit App <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/healthfit/id1202650514?mt=8&at=1010lLeL>`_ , which not only supports the recorded activities of Apple Watch, but also all activities that other apps send to HealthKit.
