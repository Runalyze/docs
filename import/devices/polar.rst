Direct sync with Polar
========================

We are working on it!

Data export powered by Polar
==============================
At `Polar account management <https://account.polar.com/#export>`_ you will be able to export all your data (this feature is planned by Polar - we don't know when they go live with that feature)

.. note::
    You can write a support message to mail@runalyze.com with an attached backup of your files. We will import them into your account. Don't forget to mention your username.


Third Party Software
======================
There is a software called `bipolar <https://github.com/pcolby/bipolar>`_ which can download the activites from Polar FlowSync, PolarV800 or Polar Loop
and there is another software called `V800 Downloader <https://github.com/profanum429/v800_downloader>`_ on Github which does nearly the same.
