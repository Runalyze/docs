It seems that all files will be stored on your computer as soon as you connect your device::

    OS (C:) / user / <name of user> / Tom Tom MySports / <name of clock >
There you'll find a folder for every day with \*.ttbin files.

Have a look at the following article at `dcrainmaker.com <http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2014/01/releases-uploading-multisport.html>`_ if you're using the iPhone App.

If you're using a MAC/Linux system you can get the files `via usb <https://github.com/ryanbinns/ttwatch>`_ or `via bluetooth <https://github.com/dlenski/ttblue>`_ from your watch

If you're using a Windows PC you can get the files via usb `with this open source software <https://github.com/altera2015/ttwatcher/releases>`_.
