"One of the most common questions at RUNALYZE is about elevation values. "
"There is a lack of clarity regarding the elevation correction and its "
"calculation. Many people just don't know how elevation has to be handled and"
" why there is no proper value."

"Let's start with the recording of an activity. Not only the position in "
"terms of latitude/longitude but also the elevation is determined via GPS."

msgid ""
"This sounds great but it isn't: Every owner of a gps-device knows that the "
"GPS quality can vary extremely. Concerning the total distance these "
"variations are negligible. It doesn't matter if you're running 10 meters to "
"the left or right of the way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../calculations/elevation.rst:16
msgid ""
"But the same variations apply for the recorded elevation – and for elevation"
" it's a significant difference if you are running 10 meters higher or lower."
msgstr ""

#: ../../calculations/elevation.rst:18
msgid ""
"That's why elevation data obtained via GPS is unusable and an elevation "
"correction is used by default. This applies to any platform like Garmin "
"Connect, Polar Flow as well."

#: ../../calculations/elevation.rst:24
msgid ""
"The prinicple of elevation correction is quite simple. The respective "
"altitude of every pair of coordinates is determined from some digital "
"elevation model, in general an elevation profile of the global surface."

"An example for such a dataset are SRTM files (Shuttle Radar Topography "
"Mission from 2000). They are freely available in a grid of 90x90m. The "
"resolution is not perfect and these datasets are noisy, but they are usually"
" the best fit if there are no barometric measurements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../calculations/elevation.rst:28
msgid ""
"This dataset can be accessed via public APIs of Geonames.org or GoogleMaps, "
"but the number of requests is limited. At RUNALYZE we're hosting our own "
"SRTM files nowadays to get an accurate elevation profile for your activity."

#: ../../calculations/elevation.rst:30
msgid ""
"**Conclusion:** The best elevation profile is obtained via barometric "
"measurements. Users with devices that do not include a barometric altimeter "
"**should always enable the elevation correction**. But remember: This "
"elevation correction does only mean that we correct the elevation profile "
"(based on satellite data). This does not yield a single, \"true\" elevation "
"value for your activity."

msgid ""
"Most runners do not only want to see a nice elevation profile. They are "

"\"elevation\" of an activity)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../calculations/elevation.rst:43
msgid ""
"But - and that's probably new to you as you're forced to read this article -"
" obtaining such a value is far away from trivial. Most people think that a "
"fixed elevation profile generates a fixed elevation value, but that's not "
"true."
msgstr ""

#: ../../calculations/elevation.rst:46
msgid ""
"The problem is that there is no \"real\" value. Ask yourself: How would do "
"you define this elevation value? As sum of all differences in altitude? Even"
" if it's only 10cm of a sidewalk? And what's with small stones under your "
"feet or potholes?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../calculations/elevation.rst:48
msgid ""
"Be sure: That's not what you want. It's simple to calculate the total "
"elevation of a steady uphill course: highest point - lowest point = "
"elevation gain. But that's not possible for hilly terrains and urban areas."

"**No smoothing** is the naive approach to sum up all ups and downs. You can "
"always change the smoothing algorithm in your settings – afterwards you can "
"let RUNALYZE recalculate all elevation values (Tools -> database cleanup -> "
"Loop through activities (activate \"Recalculate elevation\" & \"Recalculate "
"VDOT values\")). You will notice that without smoothing far too high values "
"will appear."

msgid ""
"In the **threshold method** small elevation differences are ignored. The "
"threshold for this can be adjusted in the configuration. We have achieved "
"good results with a threshold of 3 meters. Therefore any difference of only "
"one or two meters is ignored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../calculations/elevation.rst:64
msgid ""
"If you are moving just slowly uphill or downhill on a course the threshold "
"method will have a problem. All elevation differences between two "
"consecutive data points that are smaller than the threshold will be ignored."
" That's where the Douglas-Peucker-algorithm comes into play."

"This is definitely a complicated topic and we can't set your settings such "
"that you obtain \"true\" values - simply because no one knows them. There is"
" no 'truth' in this case. But you can adapt the settings to your needs, such"
" that you are satisfied with your calculated values. They won't match your "
"devices values exactly, but that shouldn't be the point."
