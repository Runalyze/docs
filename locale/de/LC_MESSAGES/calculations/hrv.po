"Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in"
" the time interval between heartbeats and is measured by the variation in "
"the beat-to-beat interval. It is well known that HRV is directly related to "
"the body's interdependent regulatory systems and can be a powerful measure "
"for an athlete's recovery status."

"It is best practice to measure you heart rate variability on a daily basis "

"not what is contained in all that data you upload to Runalyze. Instead, you "
"go out for a run or a ride and measure your heart rate (and its variability)"
