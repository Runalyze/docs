"|VO2max| is a measure for your personal capabilities and can be "
"calculated based on a current (and *good*) race result. It can be used to"
" get a prognosis for a half marathon based on your personal best for 10k "
"or compare your personal bests of different distances."

"In general, that's not sufficient. Runners want to know about their shape"
" (i.e. optimal training paces and a prognosis for the upcoming race) "
"while training for some event, not right after it."
msgstr ""
"En général, cela n'est pas suffisant. Les coureurs veulent connaître leur "
"forme (par exemple, leur allure optimales d'entrainement et un pronostic "

"après."

"Therefore, RUNALYZE estimates your current |VO2max| based on your "
"activities. (*Again: it's an estimation - not an exact calculation!*) "
"This estimation is based on your heart rate and your running pace. There "
"are several studies for an approximate relation between heart rate and "
"percentage of velocity at |VO2max|. Your current |VO2max| shape is based "
"on the average of the last 30 days."
msgstr ""

"Still, this estimation is not that easy all the time. The maximal heart "
"rate must be known and the heart rate graph of your activity must not go "
"haywire due to a defect heart rate strap or other influences. RUNALYZE "
"gives you the option to ignore an activity for your |VO2max| estimation "
"(e.g. for activities with long pauses) to solve this problem."

"In addition, everybody's heart rate may behave differently and does not "
"need to follow the approximate equations. RUNALYZE uses an additional "
"*correction factor* which is just multiplied with the calculated value. "
"This factor is calculated based on your *best* race and its heart rate. "
"If this factor does not fit for you, just pick a manual factor "
"(*Configuration -> General settings -> |VO2max|*)."

"|VO2max| is a scientific metric for the maximal oxygen uptake that is "
"highly correlated with your maximal running performance, but depends on "
"the runners efficiency. Two runners with equal |VO2max| values do not "
"need to perform equal. That's why we use the *Effective |VO2max|* that "
"somehow ignores the efficiency and *is* equal for runners with same "
"results for e.g. a 10k race. In addition to common calculators that "
"estimate |VO2max| based on a race result, we estimate your |VO2max| for "
"every activity based on the relation of your heart rate and pace."
