"Every activity of any sport can be marked as *race* by simply checking "
"the respective checkbox. Activities marked as race will generate a new "
"entry as *race result*. You can add and edit some of the race result "
"details such as the official distance and duration (which may differ from"
" what you have stopped on your device) and your placements in the event."

"Please make sure that you enter common distances exactly. The result will"
" be treated as 10k race if and only if the official distance is entered "
"as *10.00 km*. This applies in particular for half-marathons (*21.10 km*)"
" and marathons (*42.20 km*)."

"From v2.6 on, races are independent of the activity type and sport type. "
"By default, RUNALYZE comes with an activity type for races. Choosing this"
" type for an activity does *not* mark it automatically as official race "
"(as this activity type is not fixed and can be renamed or enitrely "
"removed)."
