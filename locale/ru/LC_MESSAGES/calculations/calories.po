"Figuring out how many calories you burn when running, cycling or "
"whatsoever is not easy and, to be honest, we did not put much effort into"
" this topic so far. For the time being, RUNALYZE does use values provided"
" within uploaded files and does not recalculate this value. This value is"
" only recalculated if you've checked *Calculate calories* in your "
"configuration *and* change the duration of the activity. In this case "
"burned calories are calculated by simply multiplying the activity's "
"duration by your sports setting *kilocalories per hour*."
