"Yes, definitely! Our first concern is providing an API to work with "
"`tapiriik <https://tapiriik.com/>`_. Still, there are some months of work"

"RUNALYZE is more than just a logbook to track all your activities. In "

" VDOT and prognoses for your upcoming races. We are using some formulas "
"to estimate your current shape based on the ratio of heart rate and pace."

"Most file types do not contain information about pauses. Especially tcx- "
"and gpx-files provide no information if and when you stopped your device,"
" e.g. at traffic lights or if you're using 'auto pause' on your device. "
"Runalyze offers the ability to detect such breaks automatically and can "
"remove them without further notice. Still, it's difficult or even "
"impossible to exactly match your device's total duration."

"You can enable/disable our automatic detection of pauses in your "
