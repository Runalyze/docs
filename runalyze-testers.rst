For RUNALYZE testers
=====================

How to become a tester
-----------------------

We're always looking for new tester for upcoming releases.

If you have an account in our official version at runalyze.com just leave us a mail with your username. You will get further information as soon as we are starting the next test phase.


Introduction for testers of our official RUNALYZE installation
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you're a tester of the upcoming RUNALYZE version we will copy your data of your account at runalyze.com to a temporary installation at testing.runalyze.com. We’ll provide a list of all changes and things you definetly should test. You can simply login with your official account.

Outside of the test phase it will happen that the version at testing.runalyze.com won't work. We are just updating and copying the user data for the version during the test phase.

Don't forget that we have to delete all data of testing.runalyze.com sometimes during and after the test phase. Just use it for this exact testing purpose - there won’t be any synchronization back to the official version at runalyze.com. Before each test phase, we’ll just import your ‘real’ data from runalyze.com again.

Most of the features we are adding in upcoming releases to RUNALYZE are already tested by some candidates and by our automatic tests, but it can always happen that we make mistakes which are not covered by automatic tests.

Please report your problems in our `forum <https://forum.runalyze.com>`_ or leave us a mail, if ...

* something seems strange to you.
* something is not working the way you are expecting.
* or you just want to say something about a new feature.

In case of an error ...

* tell us what you tried to do.
* tell us at which time you tried it (we will look into our log files).

We are happy that you help us to improve the quality of RUNALYZE. Feedback is always appreciated!
