=======================
Configuration of sports
=======================

With this tutorial we want to show you how to add and edit a new sport.

Adding is as easily as editing a existing sport.
Just fill out the greyed-out row and click the save button.

.. note::
          We always import all data we can read from any device/file.


We are now going to explain every configuration setting:

^^^^
Icon
^^^^

You can set here the icon for your (new) sport.

^^^^
Name
^^^^

Should speak for itself. Type in the name of the sport

^^^^^^
kcal/h
^^^^^^
How many calories are burned in an hour?
Attention! If you import activites from an sport watch, which already contains the value of the burned calories, that value will be used.
If the value is not present the calories will be calculated based on this configuration value.

^^^^
Ø HR
^^^^

You can set here the value for the average heart rate. This value is used for the TRIMP calculation.

^^
km
^^

If the sport has a distance value you have to check this box. If not uncheck this box.

^^^^
Unit
^^^^

Here you can set the speed unit. This unit is shown everywhere in connection with the distance.

^^^^^
Types
^^^^^

If you checked the box here, you will be able to add different sport types to this sport.

^^^^^
Power
^^^^^

Check this box if the power (watt) is recorded or manually calculated. If it's unchecked the data won't be shown.

^^^^^^^
Outside
^^^^^^^

This checkbox activates the fields routes and weather in the form.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Calendar view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can choose here the type of presentation of an activity in the databrowser/calendar.
“Complete row” means that you see the complete dataset (as configured in the dataset configuration)
 “Only icon” means that only the icons of the sport shows up in the databrowser/calendar.
