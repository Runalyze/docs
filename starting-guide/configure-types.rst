===============================
Configuration of activity types
===============================

If you have activated the “Types” checkbox in the sport configuration of a sport, you can define different activity types

For running we already added some types to make the start with RUNALYZE easy.

Activity types are useful to seperate your training into different categories.

We are now going to explain every activity type configuration setting:

^^^^
Name
^^^^

Should speak for itself. Type in the “long” name of the activity type.

^^^^^^^^^^^^
Abbreviation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The abbreviation is e.g. used in the databrowser and everywhere where the name is too long.

^^^^^
Sport
^^^^^

Select the sport for this activity type.

^^^^
Ø HR
^^^^

Such as the “Ø HR” field in the sport configuration the Ø HR is used for the TRIMP calculation. This overrides the sport configuration setting.

^^^^^^^^
Quality?
^^^^^^^^

If the activity type is a qualitiy session (interval training, tempo runs) check the box.

^^^^
Race
^^^^

If the activity type is the “Race” type for the sport check the box.

.. note::
          Currently you just can set a “Race” typ for running. We will change this in the future!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Calendar view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can choose here the typ of presentation of an activity in the databrowser/calendar.
“Complete row” means that you see the complete dataset (as configured in the dataset configuration)
 “Only icon” means that only the icons of the sport shows up in the databrowser/calendar.
This overrides the sport configuration setting.

.. note::
        Activity types can only be deleted, when no activity references exists.
