In this fast start guide we just want to show you how to add your first activity to RUNALYZE.

The plus button opens a dialog window where you can manually add or upload an activity.

We support a wide range of file formats, just pick whatever your device produces (\*.tcx and \*.gpx are most common, \*.fit is the only one containing all data).
After uploading a file you'll see the default form for manually adding an activity. Check the values, add some data if you want to and click *Create*. â€“ That's it.
