Races
=====

Every activity of any sport can be marked as *race* by simply checking the
respective checkbox. Activities marked as race will generate a new entry as
*race result*. You can add and edit some of the race result details such as
the official distance and duration (which may differ from what you have stopped
on your device) and your placements in the event.

Please make sure that you enter common distances exactly. The result will be
treated as 10k race if and only if the official distance is entered as
*10.00 km*. This applies in particular for half-marathons (*21.10 km*) and
marathons (*42.20 km*).

.. note::
    RUNALYZE comes with an activity type for races. Choosing this type
    for an activity does *not* mark it automatically as official race (as this
    activity type is not fixed and can be renamed or enitrely removed).
