==================
Supported sensors
==================

As Garmin extended the FIT file format, external sensors can now write their own
data into any FIT file. This allows third party devices to write data that's not
part of the official FIT specification. In addition, sensors can write their own
data for common fields (e.g. distance, heart rate, power, ...) without being
connected as the respective sensor. Previously, Stryd was only able to record
power data in cycling mode.

We are trying to add all supported sensors to this list. Tell us if you know
that we support further external sensors. - And, of course, provide us with
sample files if your sensor is not supported but will definetly enhance the
analysis.

.. note::
          We will add further data fields to RUNALYZE in the future. Leave us a
          message if you are a sensor manufacturer, your sensor data is written
          to fit files and you are interested, that we add it to RUNALYZE.
