==================
Supported sensors
==================

Since Garmin has extended their FIT file format a lot of new data can be written by external sensors.

We are trying to add all supported sensors to this list. Tell us if you know that we support further external sensors.

.. note::
          We will add further data fields to RUNALYZE in the future. Leave us a message if you are a sensor manufacturer and your sensor data is written to fit files.
