Translation
============

RUNALYZE is multilanguage and as we are not speaking every language we need your help to translate RUNALYZE into the different languages.

You can easily translate RUNALYZE into your language at `translate.runalyze.com <http://translate.runalyze.com>`_. Before you can start translating, you have to register there. Everyone can help us to translate Runalyze. It is easy!

*Some translations may be very difficult to understand without context.*

But you have to options:

* You can comment under each translation string if you have questions. We will answer them.
* Have a look at http://live.translate.runalyze.com/ where you find a live updated (every two minutes) version of the translations.


.. note::
          We are updating the translation of our official hosted version (runalyze.com) at irregular intervals. We are adding a language offically to RUNALYZE if the translation hits the "magic" 90%.
