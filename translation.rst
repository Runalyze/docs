============

RUNALYZE is multilingual and comes with a small set of supported languages.
Translations are mainted by our users - and this includes *you*.

By registering at `translate.runalyze.com <http://translate.runalyze.com/>`_ you
can translate RUNALYZE into any missing language or help to improve existing
translations.

If you have problems to understand the original string without context you have
two options:

* Leave a comment for the respective string
* Take a look at the *Source string location* (mentioned on the right side)
* Take a look at `live.translate.runalyze.com <http://live.translate.runalyze.com/>`_.
  This version is updated every two minutes with current translations.

.. note::
    Translations are merged into our development branch and updated in our
    official online version at irregular intervals. New languages will be added
    there as soon as they reach the *magic* limit of 90 %.
